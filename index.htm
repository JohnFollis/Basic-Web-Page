<p> Reflecting back on this class and it's real life implications where actually amazing.  In my current job I REALLY needed a refresher on Excel.  The first part of the month involved several spreadsheets that covered all 2241 phones in the building.  Mine looked better and had more functionality than my co workers and we eventually adopted it.  Eventhough I use Word everyday, I, like most here at work don't take the time that a class sets aside to allow you to learn how to use it's many advanced features. I'm grateful for this class.</p>
